    default n
    help
      Add a defensive warning system to the Thunder. It increases the footprint
      of the Thunder application but it allows for profiling and early warning
      on misbahving plugins. This feature should be used at least once before
      creating a production build to get a feeling on the behaviour of new
      plugins. They should not raise any warnings here !!!

config BR2_PACKAGE_BRIDGE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING
    bool "ExceptionCatching"
    default n
    help
      Some plugins are developed with Exception handling turned on. If an exception
      is not caught in the plugin it ends up in the framework. This feature tries
      to recover from these uncaught execptions. If it happens on a workerpool thread
      the framework will catch it, report it and continue. If the exception is thrown
      from a thread not under control of the framework it reports and shutsdown the
      framework. There is no possibility to recover from it.
